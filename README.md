### Hey there, I'm R1ad ðŸ‘‹


I'm a final year student at the higher school of computer science 08-MAI-1945 and I'm interested by Cyber security, Networking and Machine Learning.

- I'm continuously trying to learn something new in every field I'm interested in.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects
- I'm either coding, playing CTFs with [OctaC0re](https://ctftime.org/team/141485), playing chess or multitasking.
- You can contact me at zr.mordi@gmail.com
